# image-scratch-detection
This project detects and classifies scratches in images using ResNet50 for classification and Mask R-CNN for scratch localization. It classifies images as "Good" (no scratches) or "Bad" (scratches present) and locates the scratches with bounding boxes or masks, useful for quality control in manufacturing.
